# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
To clean and organise the data into an easily readable format with which I can glean meaningful insights and information.
## Process
1. After loading the data in I will familiarise myself with the dataset, what the different columns are and how the data all links together.
2. After looking at the kind of questions being asked I will look through the required data and clean it up for legibility, repitiveness
3. Answer the set questions and try to glean some useful insights
4. Create charts and powerpoint to explain insights.

## Results
We are able to see our repeat usage and sales data for the snapshot of data we have, organised in a vastly more legible fashion. 


## Challenges 
No real Primary Keys
Data has not been normalized
Same data repeated in multiple parts of the database with different values



## Future Goals
With more time with the database I would work on splitting it out further into several more tables with meaningful primary keys and foreign keys to normalise it all.
